1. Statistical transformations:
-standardization: z = (ùë•i ‚àí x) / s, where x is mean, s is standard deviation
-log transformation: z = log(xi): transform a skewed distribution into normal
-box-cow transformation: transform a skewed distribution into normal

2. Some terms are used interchangeable: spatial estimation / spatial interpolation /
/ spatial prediction / spatial statistical modelling / griding in some GIS applications
the process of using known values to estimate values at other locations

3. nuance between spatial interpolation & spatial prediction
spatial interpolation: using single variable to estimate unknown values (use station data to estimate whole area)
spatial prediction: using same and other variables to estimate unknown values (use both elevation and station data to estimate unknown data)

4. how things distribute in space:
spatial heterogeneity (first-order effect aka general trend)
spatial dependence (second-order effect also known as spatial autocorrelationÔºâ

first order and second order, they work together to define the spatial patterns

5. three perspectives to categorize spatial estimation methods:
(1) Global vs Local: use all known values to estimate unknown values vs use neighbohood to estimate values
(2) Deterministic vs Stochastic: use pre-defined function produce estimations without error consideration vs use 
statistical models with assessment of prediction errors
(3) Exact vs Inexact: predicted values are same as the known values vs predicted values are different from the known value

6. Examples of spatial estimation methods:
(1) Thiessen Polygen (nearest neighbor):
-deterministic and local 
-assign the neareast sample values to the interpolated value

(2) Fixed radius:
-deterministic and local 
-depends on the search radius
-based on the average of nearby samples determined by the fixed radius sample size 

(3) Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW)
-deterministic and local 
-weight of each sample point is an inverse proportion to the distance, the closer the more weighted
-zj = sum(zi/dij to the power of n)/sum(1/(dij to the power of n))
   e.g. when n = 1, distance are 3 4 5; values are 40 60 80:
   ((40/3) + (60/4) + (80/5)) / ((1/3) + (1/4) +(1/5))
-local influences are stronger: increase exponent n; Or decrease the sample point
-a larger number of sample points makes the result a smoother surface
