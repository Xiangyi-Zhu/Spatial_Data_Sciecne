1. data wrangling: represent the dataset as an appropriate spatial dataset and ready for analysis
missing values, outliers, inconsistancey, different scales, incorrect spatial projection...

2. Some ways to get geospatial data:
Data cleaning: geocoding (from address to lat & longi info)
               data representation (vector or raster)   
               spatial join (have same attribute column, then join OR based on spatial pattern) 
               (e.g., extracting values from raster to vector / extracting values from vector to raster)
Data Engineering: statistical transformations
                  categorial varible
                  geometry operation (change shape or size) 
Geoenrichment: associate geometry to an attribute table

2. representation of spatio-temperal data: space-time cube
(1) challenges:
have 4 dimensions: x, y, t, value
interplay of relationship in different dimensions is cumbersome
data itself is not perfect: missing value, inconsistant measurement(irregularly spaced stations/data collected at different time)
(2) visualization of space-time data
time-only visualization: 
-time-series for each location is plotted to inspect patterns (e.g.,line chart)
-data-clock

space-time visualization:
-time vs latitude
-time vs longitude

time-slice representation: visualize data at a give time on 2D

3. spatio-temporal data wrangling:
fill missing values: data imputation
-spatial neighbors statistics (time-slice)
-temperal interpolation (time-series)
-space-time neighbors statistics (4D: x, y, t, values)
