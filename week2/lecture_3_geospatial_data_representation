1. data wrangling: represent the dataset as an appropriate spatial dataset and ready for analysis
missing values, outliers, inconsistancey, different scales, incorrect spatial projection...

2. Some ways to get geospatial data:
Data cleaning: geocoding (from address to lat & longi info)
               data representation (vector or raster)   
               spatial join (have same attribute column / spatial pattern) (e.g., extracting values from raster)
Data Engineering: statistical transformations
                  categorial varible
                  geometry operation (change shape or size) 
Geoenrichment: associate geometry to an attribute table
