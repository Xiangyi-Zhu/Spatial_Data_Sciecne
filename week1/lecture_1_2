1. Spatial data science workflow:
clean data - exploratory data analysis - make model - model relationships & make prediction - make a decision

2. Components of computational tasks:
Task (to identify problem)- experience (data and model) - performance (examine the model)

3. The main difference between data science and spatial data science:
spatial autocorrelation - the spatial data are not independent from each other, which violates a lots of assumption in statistical modeling.

4. Spatial Data Science is an interdiscipline (GIS & machine learning & spatial statistics)

5. spatially explicit model

6. spatial clustering == regionalization (with / without an explicit spatial contiguity constraints)

7. Spatial data has both spatial and non-spatial properties about entities

8. Two ways of viewing the world:
discrete object
continuous field

9. Examples of spatial relationship:
adjacency:share a common boundary
connectivity: intersect with each other
containment: situated inside

10. Pitfalls of spatial data:
(1) spatial autocorrelation: how similar one data point is to other data points around it
(2) modifiable areal unit problem
